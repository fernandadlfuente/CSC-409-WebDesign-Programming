    <h2> Scape Park at Cap Cana </h2>
    <p>
    The first place I would recommend going is called Scape Park at Cap Cana. Its for all ages! Whether you seek adventure, relaxation or cultural immersion there's something for everyone! From ziplining through lush canopies to exploring mysterious caves and cenotes. For families with kids, miniscape is an area specifically designed for them offering obstacle courses, diving into crystalline waters and waterfalls.

        <div class = "text-box">
        <h3> Saona Island </h3>
        <p>The second place I would recommend going is called Saona Island. Its a separate Island where you hop on a speed boat for them to take you to the Island. They drive you through the ocean with the bluest and clearest water. The first stop the boat takes you is what they called "a natural swimming pool" in the middle of the Caribbean where everyone just enjoys their time especially with a floating bar. From there, they take you to the actual island where they have lunch and loungers.

<div class = "text-box">            
    <h4> Macao Beach </h4>

        <p>The third place I would recommend going is called Macao beach. You can go horseback riding and swim with horses. You can also go on ATVs where they'll take you through farmlands and swimming holes in caves.

<div class = "text-box">            
    <h5> Coco Bongo </h5>

        <p>The fourth place I would recommend going is more of a night life activity, its called Coco Bongo. It is a large famous nightlife venue which has dance performances, a mix of a lot of music, open bars and interactive shows. The experience lasts for about 3 hours and is followed by a large open party that continues until the next morning.
